The legality of the Palestinian passport follows what was agreed upon at the Oslo accord in 1993. These passports were first issued in April of 1995 by the Palestinian Authority to facilitate Palestinian travel. The Passport is valid for five years and Palestinians whom holding a Palestinian ID (Mainly Palestinians who live in the West Bank and Gaza Strip) are eligible to get it. Palestinians whom living in diaspora (Refugee camps in Arabic countries and around the world) and don’t have a Palestinian ID. They do hold a travel document for refugees and basically, they are not allowed to get the Palestinian passport unless there is a special situation.




The clear delineator that has separated and dictated the lives of these Palestinians is the colour-coded identification system issued by the Israeli military and reinforced in 1981 through its Civil Administration branch. Palestinians in the occupied West Bank and the Gaza Strip have green IDs – generally issued once they turn 16 – while Palestinians in East Jerusalem have blue IDs.
